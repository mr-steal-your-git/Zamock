Rolling Code (purely for comparison with Time Sychronization)

10 more registers X-Y-Z registers are admins with super access.

AT+MODE sleep command to enable power saving.

Dual authentication - if the user is has a matching UID to one of the registers, they must also be clocked in to access the entrance. 
This is a step to a layered security system that is resilient against hackers who just copy a users key ID.

Being synced to a clock in clock out system hypoethically increased the surface area for attack for the system.

Time Synchronization

A physical lock component?
